# Arachne

## Protocol

The Arachne protocol is a simple protocol that allows for clients to connect to an authorative server using some kind of identification, and will then allow the client and server to communicate with each other. This protocol is very simple and is primarily designed to be used in games, but could potentially be used in other applications as well.

It uses UDP for all communication and allows for 4 different ways of communication:

- **Unreliably unordered** - This is the default way of communication, and is the fastest. It is not guaranteed that the message will arrive, and it is not guaranteed that the messages will arrive in the order they were sent.

- **Reliably unordered** - This is a slower way of communication, but it is guaranteed that the message will arrive, however not guaranteed that the messages will arrive in the order they were sent.

- **Unreliably ordered** - No guarantee that the message will arrive, however it is guaranteed that the messages will arrive in the order they were sent.

- **Reliably ordered** - This is the slowest way of communication, but it is guaranteed that the message will arrive, and it is guaranteed that the messages will arrive in the order they were sent.

### Protocol packets

The protocol consists of a few different packets, which are mostly used for connection intialization, and connection termination.

### Connection initialization

There 2 different ways to allow for a connection to be established.

- **No authentication** - This is the simplest way of connecting, and is used when the server does not require any kind of authentication from the client. The client will simply send a `CR` packet to the server, and the server will respond with a `CRS` packet either allowing or denying the connection.

- **With authentication** - This is a more complex way of connecting, and is ued when the server requires some kind of authentication from the client. The client will send a `CR` packet to the server, and the server will respond with a `CH` packet, which will contain a challenge for the client. The client will then respond with a `CHR` packet, which will contain the challenge response. The server will then respond with a `CRS` packet either allowing or denying the connection. The authentication method is up to the developer to implement, however, there are some examples provided if needed.

#### **Connection Request (CR)**

This packet is sent by the client to the server, and is used to request a connection to the server. The server will then respond with a Connection Response packet.

If the given `protocol id` and `protocol version` is not supported by the server, the server will respond with a `CRS` packet with failure and reason `Unsupported protocol version`.

```
[packet type = 0x00] (1 byte)
[protocol id]        (4 bytes)
[protocol version]   (4 bytes)
[client id]          (8 bytes)
```

#### **Connection Challenge (CH)**

This packet is sent by the server to the client, and is used to challenge the client to prove that it is allowed to connect. The client will then respond with a `CHR` packet.

The packet can contain anything that the developer so chooses, and it is up to the developer to implement this.

```
[packet type = 0x01] (1 byte)
[challenge] (variable length)
```

#### **Connection Challenge Response (CHR)**

This packet is sent by the client to the server, and is used to respond to the challenge that the server sent. The server will then respond with a `CRS` packet.

```
[packet type = 0x02] (1 byte)
[challenge response] (variable length)
```

#### **Connection Response (CRS)**

This packet is sent by the server to the client, and is used to respond to a Connection Request packet. This response will either be a success or a failure, and upon failure, the packet will also contain a reason for the failure.

```
[packet type = 0x03] (1 byte)
[success] (1 byte)
[reason length] (uint32, 4 bytes)
[reason string] (variable length, UTF-8 encoded)
```

### During connection packets

#### **Connection Keep Alive (KA)** (not implemented yet)

This packet is sent by the client to the server, and is used to keep the connection alive. The server will not respond to this packet, it is only for the server to know if the client is still alive and connected.

`KA` packets are sent every 5 seconds by default, but this can be changed by the developer.

If no `KA` packets are received from a connected client within a specified timeout, the server will consider the client to be disconnected and will remove the client from its list of connected clients.

```
[packet type = 0x04] (1 byte)
[client id] (8 bytes)
```

#### **Application Data (AD)**

This packet can be sent by either the client or the server, and is used to send application data to the other party. The packet can contain any kind of data that the developer so chooses.

```
[packet type = 0x05] (1 byte)
[application data] (variable length)
```

### Connection termination

#### **Connection Termination (CT)**

This packet is sent by either the client or the server, and is used to terminate the connection. The packet can contain a reason for the termination. The other party should then respond with a `CTA` packet, to acknowledge the termination.

```
[packet type = 0x06] (1 byte)
[reason length] (uint32, 4 bytes)
[reason string] (variable length, UTF-8 encoded)
```

#### **Connection Termination Acknowledgement (CTA)**

This packet is sent by either the client or the server, and is used to acknowledge the termination of the connection.

```
[packet type = 0x07] (1 byte)
```
